NAME
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::RSRCHBOY - Zilla your distributions like
    RSRCHBOY!

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.042 of
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::RSRCHBOY - released August 04, 2013 as part
    of Dist-Zilla-PluginBundle-RSRCHBOY.

SYNOPSIS
        # in your dist.ini...
        [@RSRCHBOY]

DESCRIPTION
    This is RSRCHBOY's current Dist::Zilla dist.ini config for his packages.
    He's still figuring this all out, so it's probably wise to not depend on
    this being too terribly consistent/sane until the version gets to 1.

METHODS
  release_plugins
    Plugin configuration for public release.

  author_tests
  meta_provider_plugins
    Plugins that mess about with what goes into META.*.

  configure
    Preps plugin lists / config; see Dist::Zilla::Role::PluginBundle::Easy.

  ensure_current
    Sometimes things change. (I know, I know, the horror!) This seeks to
    minimize that pain by automatically making what changes it can.

  stopwords
    A list of words our POD spell checker should ignore.

OPTIONS
  sign (boolean; default: true)
    On release, use your gpg key to sign the version tag created (if you're
    using git) and also generate a SIGNATURE file.

    See also Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Signature.

  tweet (boolean; default: false)
    If set to a true value, we'll use Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Twitter to tweet
    when a release occurs.

  github (boolean; default: true)
    This enables various GitHub related plugins to update dist and GitHub
    metadata automatically.

  install_on_release (boolean; default: true)
    After a release, install the distribution locally. Our default install
    command is (from inside the built release directory):

        cpanm .

    You can change this by setting the "InstallRelease.install_command"
    option.

BUNDLED PLUGIN OPTIONS
    It's possible to pass options to our bundled plugins directly:

        ; format is Plugin::Name.option
        [@RSRCHBOY]
        GatherDir.exclude_filename = cpanfile

    For information on specific plugins and their options, you should refer
    to the documentation of Dist::Zilla::Role::PluginBundle::Config::Slicer.
