    Dist-Zilla-PluginBundle-RSRCHBOY.

SYNOPSIS
        # in your dist.ini...
        [@RSRCHBOY]

DESCRIPTION
    This is RSRCHBOY's current Dist::Zilla dist.ini config for his packages.
    He's still figuring this all out, so it's probably wise to not depend on
    this being too terribly consistent/sane until the version gets to 1.

METHODS
  copy_from_build
    Returns a list of files that, once built, will be copied back into the
    root.

  release_plugins
    Plugin configuration for public release.

  author_tests
  meta_provider_plugins
    Plugins that mess about with what goes into META.*.

  configure
    Preps plugin lists / config; see Dist::Zilla::Role::PluginBundle::Easy.

  stopwords
    A list of words our POD spell checker should ignore.

OPTIONS
  sign (boolean; default: true)
    On release, use your gpg key to sign the version tag created (if you're
    using git) and also generate a SIGNATURE file.

    See also Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Signature.

  tweet (boolean; default: false)
    If set to a true value, we'll use Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Twitter to tweet
    when a release occurs.

BUNDLED PLUGIN OPTIONS
    It's possible to pass options to our bundled plugins directly:

        ; format is Plugin::Name.option
