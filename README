NAME
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::RSRCHBOY - Zilla your Dists like RSRCHBOY!

VERSION
    version 0.001

DESCRIPTION
    This is RSRCHBOY's current Dist::Zilla dist.ini config for his packages.
    He's still figuring this all out, so it's probably wise to not depend on
    this being too terribly consistent/sane until the version gets to 1.
